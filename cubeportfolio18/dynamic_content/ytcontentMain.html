        <b>Motion Clip and Animation Footages</b> I have created as raw material collections of the art video works that I have just made by learning of videography or filmmaker and animation. I am very excited to improve the skills and taste in graphic and motion art. So at this page I would like to show you some of the video footages that most inspired by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/g/ketutagussuardika" rel="nofollow">Shutterstock</a>&nbsp;Footages which is give me much experience in order to make graphic motion art. This page is a media collections of clip video footages to practice my skill in shutting and editing of the video. Mastering video editing software&nbsp;becomes a very important thing. For me I love to use adobe software, such as <b>Adobe Photoshop,&nbsp;</b><b>Adobe</b><b>&nbsp;illustrator,&nbsp;</b><b>Adobe</b><b>&nbsp;Premiere, Adobe After Effects and&nbsp;</b><b>Adobe Audition</b><b>&nbsp;</b>to make clip video and footages looks more interesting and professional.
